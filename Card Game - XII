/*

Patrick started to play a card game â€“XII. In this game, he has to choose three cards, based on the card number present in the third card he will be a winner. With the help of Johnny, he inferred a pattern in the third card number was the Least Common Multiple of first and second card numbers.
So write a C program to help Patrick to choose a third card to make him win this game using while loop.

Input Format:
Input consists of 2 integers, which corresponds to the first and second card respectively.
Output Format:
Output consists of a single line. Refer sample output for details.
 
[All text in bold corresponds to input and the rest corresponds to output]

Sample Input and Output1:
Enter the first card picked up by Patrick:
15
Enter the second card picked up by Patrick:
9
Patrick must choose next card with the number 45


Problem Requirements:
C
Keyword	Min Count	Max Count
